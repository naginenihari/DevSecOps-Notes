How HTTPS works?
==================
public key and private key

SYS-1 in India SYS-2 in US
http --> plain text

http://facebook.com --> man in the middle attack

1. any message encrypted with public key can only be decrypted with private key
2. any message signed by private key can be verified by someone who have access to public key

public key --> access to everyone

https --> domain

godaddy, aws, azure, --> https vendors

browsers have all popular https vendor public keys...

browsers trust https vendors

1. first we contact vendor
2. company, address, domain, department, etc...
3. domain validation
4. they ask us to put TXT record with their provided key and value and click verify
5. then they will provide .crt and .key

.crt --> public
.key --> private

.crt we include with our website
.key we keep it in private location

facebook.com
browser --> fdsflhg77+encrypt with crt
website --> decrypt with private key and send the response to browser

all communications are encrypted
