1. Enable SonarScanner and Server in Jenkins.
2. Ask developers to onboard into sonarqube server.
3. We gave them 3 months time to clear all the backlog issues, bugs, vulnerabilities, code smells, mantaintability rating, security rating on overall code and new code.
1st week --> issues
2nd week --> vulnerabilities
3rd week --> bugs
4th week --> mantaintability rating

4. We enabled quality gates and enabled in the pipeline too using webhook but initally not aborting pipeline.
5. After 2 weeks we started aborting pipeline if quality gates.
