-v host-dir:container-dir
/usr/share/nginx/html --> nginx html dir

un-named/un-managed volumes
if we create dir and manage it then those un-named/un-managed volumes
if docker creates volumes and manages them then they are named/maanged volumes

stateless vs stateful
=====================
WEB APP DB

where data is important is called stateful applications...
app code is stateless..

volumes should be created to stateful apps. databases store the actual data is host directories, while rendering for user it will shows tables or collections

use minimal images
use official images
run it as non root containers
multi stage builds
optimise docker layers

multi stage builds are like keeping multiple Dockerfiles in a single Dockerfile, one Dockerfile we can use it as builder, another Dockerfile we can use it as final image, we can copy what we want from builder to final image. this reduces memory and then unnecessary installations

ENV MONGO="true" \
    REDIS_URL="redis://redis:6379" \
    MONGO_URL="mongodb://mongodb:27017/users"
	
1. build image
2. run image
