git reset
git revert
git squash
git stash
git cherry-pick

git reset/revert -> undo the changes you already commited

reset --> undo the changes before you commit to remote

soft mixed hard

soft --> when you do soft reset, you get the changes into staging area
mixed (default) --> deletes from local commit, staging area and keep it in workspace
hard --> deletes from local commit, staging, working area

if changes are already into remote branches

revert the changes --> but it will not delete anything, it will add the changes as new commit on top reverted commit

1 feature -> 1 commit

if a single person on one branch, you can squash the multiple commits into single commit.
git squash == git rebase -i
not recommended to do in shared branches

git stash
=========
when you are working on something in new feature branch, you got an emergency defect. We need to create hotfix branch immidiately and do the changes
git stash --> save the changes into some temp without commiting
git stash pop --> get the changes from temp area to workspace

git cherry-pick
==============
I am developing feature, but I found some parts of the feature already developed in another branch,

Continous Integration
=====================
What is CI --> It is the process integrating the code into artifact/image continously, means when developer do some commit, we can clone the code, install the dependencies, we can build the code, we can scan the code, we can unit testing finally we will build it as image

Jenkins is popular CI tool. The real power jenkins lies in plugins.

# Add required dependencies for the jenkins package
sudo yum install fontconfig java-21-openjdk jenkins -y
