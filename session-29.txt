Ansible dynamic inventory
=========================
inventory --> static, hosts are fixed

AutoScaling --> when traffic increases, infra also increases. when traffic infra also decreases
100 servers

ansible queries the ec2 instances based on some criteria...

boto3 and botocore

us-east-1 region
we need to filter the instances
	running instances
	Name --> Frontend
	
*.aws_ec2.yml/yaml

forks --> How many number of instances ansible can connected

ansible.cfg

1. ANSIBLE_CONFIG
2. ansible.cfg in pwd
3. home directory
4. etc

Ansible can query the cloud provider to fetch hosts at run time, this will be useful in the autoscaling kind of dynamic environments.


Ansible can create aws infra also...

Everything is module/collection. Ansible may require libraries. to connect AWS we need boto3 and botocore. aws configure authentication too..

1. create instances
2. create r53 records

ec2_output.results

"{{item.instances[0].private_ip_address}}"
