How to create resources in multiple AWS accounts
	dev, staging, uat, prod
	
one AWS account --> one provider --> .aws/credentials

someone polluted the resource manually in AWS. How to manage this?

terraform taint --> force AWS to recreate the resource

infra is created manually, how can you manage that with terraform?

terraform import

.tf --> create infra in AWS --> .state

infra is in AWS --> you need to get that into .tf files --> reverse engineering

import
========
1. write provider
2. write resource block with no arguments, then terraform init
3. then terraform import
4. terraform fetch all the data about resources into state file
5. write tf files using state file

You need to create parellel infra
================================
our URL --> ALB

create similar infra parellelly

create vpc
create subnets, route tables, associations
be careful data, if required use import --> only select query runs, no update, no create, no delete
Bastion
ALB --> diff arn -> diff DNS
Autoscaling

create another dummy hosted zone. create hdfcbank-automatic.com
test the entire website with dummy domain

dev.daws84s.site

dev-tf.daws84s.site

then announce downtime for 30min in midnight, then switch the ALB

dev.daws84s.site --> new ALB DNS


2 types of args
1. mutable
2. immutable

default behaviour
============
1. destroy first
2. replace next

1. create another resource
2. replace sg in instance with new sg
3. then remove old sg

Securing State
=====================
1. only terraform should create objects inside s3 bucket
2. no one should have delete access
3. a dedicate linux instance installed terraform should have role to create resources.
4. s3 bucket should only allow instances with terraform role attached
5. encyrpt state
6. enable versioning
7. users can have get state files access
8. s3 cross region replication to update changes in another region bucket
