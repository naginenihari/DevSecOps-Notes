if there are no modules available
1. develop your module
2. use shell or command module

shell vs command

you are in your house
----------------------
1. I will enter into your home and call you
	problems: security issue, you are seeing everything inside house
	shell module --> if you are using shell module, you are logging inside the server and running the tasks. redirections, variables, pipes, etc will work here
2. I will stay outside and call you
	problem: you don't get any access to things inside
	command module --> executing command from outside. you will get linux full environment
	redirections, piping and env variables will not work here
	
VARIABLE=$(command)
