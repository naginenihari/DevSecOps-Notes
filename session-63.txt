1. volumes should be outside of cluster

EBS or EFS static
=================
1. Install drivers
2. Give permissions in EC2 role
3. create volume
4. create PV(physical representation of volume)
5. create PVC
6. volume mount to pod

if EBS volume should be in the same az as in instance
if EFS SG should allow port 2049

EBS of EFS dynamic
=================
1. Install drivers
2. Give permissions in EC2 role
3. create storage class
4. create PVC with SC name, volume and PV will be created automatically
5. volume mount to pod

in case of dynamic pod pvc creates volume, so it creates in the same az where ec2 instance is there
if EFS SG should allow port 2049

Deployment vs StatefulSet
===========================
1. Deployment is for stateless applications like frontend and backend
2. StatefulSet is for DB related applications like MongoDB, MySQL, Redis, RabbitMQ, Prometheus, Grafana, ELK, etc.
3. Deployment pods can share PV and PVC, but statefulset each pod creates its own volume.
4. StatefulSet needs headless service i.e clusterIP none, because in DB environments pods should find other pods for data sync
5. Deployment pods not follows orderly manner, statefulset pods follows orderly manner. it creates <statefulset-name>-0 <statefulset-name>-1....
6. pods in statefulset keeps their identity

why I took nginx as example in statefulset, even it is frontend server?

simple example to show the data exists

kubectl apply -k "github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-ebs-csi-driver/deploy/kubernetes/overlays/stable/?ref=release-1.43"

MongoDB
========


horizontal autoscaling vs vertical autoscaling
==============================================
cpu utilisation

1. make sure metrics server is running
2. we should mention resources requests and limits

current usage
=============X100
max usage limit


taints and tolerations
======================
nodeSelector:
	az: 1b
	
kubectl label nodes ip-192-168-19-250.ec2.internal disktype=ssd

catalogue:v1 

node pulled image catalogue:v1

taint --> is like paint

kubectl taint nodes ip-192-168-19-250.ec2.internal key1=value1:NoSchedule

Scheduler --> Control plane component

why taint?

project specific hardware, seperate firewalls, performance reasons
