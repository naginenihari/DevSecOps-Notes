Ingress Controller(AWS Application LoadBalancer)
=====================
ALB Listener --> Rule --> Target Group --> VM
ALB Listener --> Rule --> Target Group --> Container/Pod

low resources, fast provisioning, fast scaling

Service: LoadBalancer --> Classic LoadBalancer (legacy). We can't extend this to multiple applications. It is not intelligent

We prefer ALB, it is intelligent highly available and scalabe. It can read URL, headers, etc and forward the traffic to different targetgroups

cart.daws84s.site --> forward to cart targetgroup

m.facebook.com --> mobile

icici.com
netbanking.icici.com --> netbanking targetgroup
corporatebanking.icici.com --> cb targetgroup

IAM --> Roles, permissions, etc.
K8 --> It is independent platform as a service. K8 has its own RBAC. Why should we integrate K8 RBAC and IAM. Because AWS services should have IAM permissions to create/manage other services. to create AWS services from K8 resources K8 SA should integrate with AWS IAM Role.
