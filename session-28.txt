Ansible Tags
=============
deployment or release new version

announce downtime 6hrs
---------------------
stop catalogue service
remove old code -> I can remove /app directory, create again and download new version code
download new code
restart catalogue

We can include other roles using include_role or import_role

include_role --> it will include tasks in run time, it will validate also in run time, it will not pre process.

Tags and when conditions apply only to the include_role statement itself, not the tasks within the role.

import_role --> ansible validate import_role before playbook execution
Tags and when conditions apply to the imported role and its tasks.

ansible error handling
======================
Error handling means what should we do when error comes, what should we do when error not comes.

if we are able to handle the error, we can keep ignore_errors true and then execute another task in case of failure

id roboshop
	if created already, we are skipping
	otherwise we are creating
	
imagine, there is no user module available

a task executes id roboshop -> task fails if user not available, usually script exit because of this error

another task create user, if rc != 0

vault
============
you can create a file and encrypt it..

SSM parameter store

Linux --> Server, Ansible --> Platform
HashiCorp Vault --> Install, manage, update, upgrade

Linux/ansible integrate with vault softwares

We were using ansible vault, but there are challenges to maintain the passwords and vaut files, so I recently proposed SSM parameter store, I did POC and Removed vault and implemented SSM parameter store successfully...
