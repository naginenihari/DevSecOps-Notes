ENTRYPOINT
=============
CMD instruction can be overriden
We can't override ENTRYPOINT, if we try to do it will override
We can use combination of CMD and ENTRYPOINT for better results, ENTRYPOINT will have command, default args can be supplied by CMD
You can always override default args through command line

ping google.com ping facebook.com

ARG
=======
ARG is build time variables, they can't be accessed inside container. ENV can be accessed build time and then inside container also
ARG instruction variables can be overriden

in an exceptional case ARG can be the first instruction to supply version to base OS in FROM, you cant use that version after FROM instruction

How can you use ARG inside container?

ONBUILD
========
While devloping images you can put some conditions while others are using your images...
