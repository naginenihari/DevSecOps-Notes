1. allow traffic from agent to eks master
2. create namespace

check rollout status, keep it in variable, write a condition using variable

1. first time failure, helm can't rollback because there will be no 0 version
2. 2nd deployment also failure, helm rollback attempts, rollback also will be failure. deployment failed and rollback failed
3. 3rd deployment success, deployment is success
4. 4th revision, failure. rollback is success, deployment is failure

scans
=======
shift left --> bringing the testing and scanning to the early stages like DEV environment is shift left instead of doing in higher environments

build once in DEV and run anywhere --> We only build the application in DEV environment, we dont build in multiple environments, we promote the application to multiple environments with different configuration

static source code analysis --> sonarqube
static application secuirty testing --> sonarqube, fortify scan, github
open source library scan --> nexus iq, github dependabot
dynamic application secuirty testing --> attacks on running application.. fortify webinspect, veracode --> Limited freetrail
docker image scan --> vulnerabilities in the images
