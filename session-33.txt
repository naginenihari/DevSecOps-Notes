Provisioners
==============
when you create the server using terraform, we can take some actions using provisioners
1. local-exec
2. remote-exec

where I run terraform command, that is local to terraform
remote means server I created using terraform

creation time provisioners
destory time provisioners

multiple infra using terraform
