Shift Left
===========
app deploy in QA SIT UAT --> test
PROD deploy --> testing, no scanning

we are using shift-left strategy for our CICD pipelines, instead of testing and scanning after deploying the application in  high environment we are doing testing and scanning in DEV environment, so we can find the issues in early stages.

freestyle pipelines --> create the pipeline in UI with some clicks.
1. cant' restore if error comes
2. can't track, no version control
3. no body remember how to do it again
4. can't re use
5. time consuming

Pre-Build 		Build 		Post-Build
Pre production production Post production    

Pre-Build -> Options, environment, where to run
Build --> Actual pipeline
Post-Build -> fail, success or anything notifications

Master Agent/Node
=================
Jenkins has to run different project pipelines. diff languages, diff versions, diff devices

Jenkins master responsibility to distribure the builds to different agents. We can have more agents with diff programming languages, diff OS and diff environment. So that load will be reduced on the master. Master collects the logs from agents and monitor them.

declrative vs scripted pipeiline
================================
scripted pipeline is old, declrative is new pipeiline from jenkins-2.X
scripted --> groovy based pipeline, feels little bit tough but you will have more control.
declrative --> syntax is easy, entire pipeline compiles before run the pipeiline
scripted --> compiles at the time of execution

we are using a mix of declrative and scripted pipeiline

GitHub Webhook
===============
When developer is in feature branch, we he push the code to remote I need to immidiately trigger jenkins pipeline automatically..

GitHub -> Jenkins
