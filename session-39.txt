1. developed on our own customised modules
2. open source modules

custom modules
===============
pros

1. everything is in our control

cons
=====
1. we need to write lot of code
2. we need to maintain

opensource modules
===============
pros
=====
1. directly use, no need to write and maintain

cons
=====
not in our control
can't fully customise
need to depend on community

vpc_ids = [
      "subnet-00817f676e3edf558",
      "subnet-0839aecc3198c3e99",
   ]

subnet-00817f676e3edf558, subnet-0839aecc3198c3e99 --> for terrform it is string  --> for AWS it is string list

Delivery Manager --> responsible for project changes delivery

if UI work --> UI team
if Backend work --> Backend team

team members == ec2 instances
team lead/DM == load balancer
rules == rules
Listeners

if cart.daws84s.site --> cart target group --> cart instance

port no 80 --> http
http://daws84s.site --> 80
https://daws84s.site --> 443

Health check
=============
http://IP:80 --> 2XX healthy

load balancer checks instances health periodically

every 10 sec, all instances in TG

consecutive 3 health check failure --> unhealthy
