SA
====
-> Access the internal workloads by communication k8 API. SA can have role and rolebinding
-> SA can fetch secrets, create ALB, any AWS service based on the role attached

1. Make sure OIDC provider exists, creates trust and federation between IAM and others
2. Create a policy

3. We can create IAM Role and attach policy.
4. We can create SA and give IAM role in annotation
or
Create SA and role through eksctl command

5. Provide sa in the pod spec.

fetch secrets
==============
follow above steps

1. Make sure secrets exists and SA have access through role and policy
2. Create initcontainer that fetch the secret and write to the volume. init container should have volume mounts to persist.
3. emptyDir is required to share the storage between containers in pod.
4. mount the same volume to the main container and access it..
5. before running command in container we need to read the secret and make it as env variable
6. now we can delete the file and start the container


1. You create LB from K8
2. You create LB outside of K8 and provide the info to K8
