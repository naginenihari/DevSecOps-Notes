Service Mesh
===============
pod to pod communication, IP address is not useful since it is ephemeral. We have services in kubernetes to acheive
1. pod to pod communication
2. load balancing

1. clusterIP --> internal to the cluster
2. nodePort --> it will open one port called nodePort in every node
3. LoadBalancer --> it will create a loadbalancer and nodePort in all the nodes

loadbalancer --> node on nodePort --> clusterIP --> pod

clusterIP --> only internal service, means with in the cluster..

How can I create multiple pods to same image?
============================================
nginx-c65pj == replicaset-name-<random 5 digit code>


Deployment
===========
a version change is there
v1, code changes --> v2
1. delete v1 application
2. download v2 application
3. restart

nginx:v1
nginx:v2

image: nginx:v2

delete old pods
create new pods with new image

pod is a subset of replicaset
replicaset is a subset of deployment
